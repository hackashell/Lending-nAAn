# Lending nAAn

## Description

Lending nAAn is a lending and borrowing Omnidapp powered by Account Abstraction. Our goal was to create a fully decentralized lending and borrowing platform with the user-friendly UX of centralized platforms. Instead of focusing on DeFi power users, who make up only 1% of all crypto-native users, we're targeting the remaining 99% and all non-crypto native (web2) users yet to discover the beauty of DeFi.

## How are we able to provide a centralized platform feel on a completely decentralized platform?

By using the Safe AA module, we can onboard users with just their email and immediately create wallets for them. Additionally, we're using Pimilico to enable gasless transactions. So, the entire "connect wallet/sign transaction" process is abstracted from the user. Also, by simplifying the UI and making certain decisions for the users (such as health factor when borrowing or the best loan provider), using our Dapp feels like using any other web2 app.

## And what's with the Omnidapp thing?

Even though it's beyond the scope of this hackathon, our users will be able to access the best deposit and borrowing options because we will integrate many different lending and borrowing platforms. That means that as a user, you'll be able to interact with all of them from a single Dapp, i.e., Lending nAAn. For this hackathon, we have only integrated Aave, though.

## Why even make a fully decentralized lending and borrowing platform that feels like centralized platforms?

Even though power users or whales sometimes seem responsible for the major funds circulation compared to shrimps, and many protocols and projects are actually focusing on this 1%, it's still nothing compared to what's happening on CEXs:

## What's after the hackathon? (versioning)

### MVP (hackathon version)
Integrate only Aave for landing and borrowing. Add AA for easy onboarding, gasless transactions and use Safe onramp kit so user can buy crypto with their credit cards.

### Lending nAAn v1
Fix bugs. Simplify UX even more after gathering feedback. Make notification systems about liquidation risk and on click risk mitigation or even opting in auto resolving. Integrate more lending and borrowing protocols like Aave to get the best prices for the users and turn Lending nAAn into true Omnidapp.

### Lending nAAn v2
Go multichain and cross chain providing option of depositing on one chain and getting the loan on another.
